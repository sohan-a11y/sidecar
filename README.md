# Sidecar

### A minimal, dark glassmorphic desktop overlay copilot that floats on top of your windows. It captures screen details, transcribes mic/system dialogue, and streams real-time AI suggestions while staying hidden from screen captures.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer — Please Read Before Use

**Sidecar's screen-invisibility is best-effort, not guaranteed.** It relies on OS-level Content Protection APIs (`setContentProtection`) and window-level flags that work with most built-in screen sharing and recording tools (Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, QuickTime, OBS window-capture). However, some capture methods — including phone cameras pointed at your screen, certain third-party proctoring software, HDMI capture cards, and full-display OBS captures — **can still see the overlay.** Do not rely on invisibility as a certainty.

**This tool is intended exclusively for legitimate, ethical purposes:**
- Personal study and self-practice (e.g., reviewing flashcards, drilling problems solo)
- Accessibility assistance (e.g., real-time captioning, cognitive aids)
- Professional productivity during your own solo work
- Learning and experimentation with AI-assisted workflows

**You must NOT use Sidecar to:**
- Cheat on proctored exams, certifications, or academic assessments
- Gain an unfair advantage during job interviews or hiring screens
- Violate any platform's Terms of Service or community guidelines
- Record, transcribe, or surveil others without their knowledge and consent, in violation of applicable privacy or wiretapping laws

**You are solely responsible for how you use this software.** The developer(s) provide it as-is and accept no liability for misuse. By using Sidecar, you agree to comply with all applicable laws, institutional policies, and platform rules in your jurisdiction.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18 or later (v20+ recommended)
- **npm**: Included with Node.js
- **Git**: To clone the repository

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sohan-a11y/sidecar.git
cd sidecar
npm install
```

### 2. Run in Development

To start the React + Vite renderer dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
In a separate terminal shell, launch the Electron wrapper:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm start        # macOS / Linux
```
```cmd
set NODE_ENV=development && npm start  :: Windows (Command Prompt)
```
```powershell
$env:NODE_ENV="development"; npm start # Windows (PowerShell)
```

---

## Build & Package

### macOS

To build and pack the native macOS `.app` bundle:
```bash
npm run pack
```
Locate the compiled bundle inside `dist/mac-arm64/Sidecar.app`. If macOS complains about ad-hoc local code signatures on first start, run:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Sidecar.app
```

### Windows

To build the Windows NSIS installer (`.exe`):
```bash
npm run pack:win
```

> **Note:** Building Windows installers from macOS requires Wine and is unreliable. For reliable Windows builds, use a native Windows machine or the included GitHub Actions workflow (see below).

The compiled installer will be located at:
```
dist/Sidecar Setup <version>.exe
```

#### Windows SmartScreen Warning

Because Sidecar is **not code-signed**, Windows Defender SmartScreen will display an "unrecognized app" warning when you first run the installer or the application:

1. Click **"More info"** in the SmartScreen dialog
2. Click **"Run anyway"** to proceed with installation

This warning is normal for unsigned applications and does not indicate malware. Proper code signing may be added in a future release.

#### GitHub Actions (Recommended for Windows Builds)

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` that automatically builds Windows installers on a native `windows-latest` runner whenever a new version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) is pushed. The resulting `.exe` is uploaded as a release artifact.

To trigger a build:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## First Launch & Onboarding

Upon opening the application, you will be greeted by the onboarding guide containing active keyboard hotkeys.


### macOS


1. **System Permissions**: Go to `System Settings → Privacy & Security`. Grant **Microphone** and **Screen Recording** access to Sidecar.
2. **Zoom Configuration**: To hide Sidecar in Zoom, open Zoom Settings, navigate to `Share Screen → Advanced`, and set **Screen capture mode** to `"Advanced capture with window filtering."`

### Windows

1. **Permissions**: Windows may prompt for microphone access on first use. Click **Allow** to enable voice capture features.
2. **Content Protection (Important)**: Sidecar uses the Windows `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` API to hide the overlay from screen captures and shares.
   - **Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or later**: Full invisibility. The overlay is completely hidden from screen capture tools, screen shares, and recording software.
   - **Older Windows versions**: The overlay will appear as a **black rectangle** in captures rather than being fully invisible. This is a limitation of the older `WDA_MONITOR` API that Electron falls back to.
   - Sidecar will display a one-time warning at startup if your Windows version does not support full content protection.
3. **Screen Sharing**: Sidecar is automatically hidden from most screen-sharing tools (Zoom, Teams, Meet) on supported Windows versions. No additional configuration is needed.

## Settings & API Keys Setup

Click the gear icon in the composer overlay to configure your settings and model credentials.

![Sidecar Settings](docs/zoom-setting.png)

- Supports **OpenAI** (defaults: `gpt-4o-mini` / `gpt-4o`), **Anthropic** (`claude-3-5-haiku-latest` / `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`), and **Google Gemini** (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite` / `gemini-2.5-flash`).
- Supports the **Google Gemini free-tier** and stable `v1beta` endpoint versions.

## How It Works (System Architecture)

Sidecar uses a decoupled architecture with a secure main-renderer IPC channel bridge:

```
Main Process (Node.js/Electron)
├── index.js (App lifecycle manager — platform-aware guards)
├── WindowManager.js (Transparent overlay, content protection + Windows version check)
├── SettingsManager.js (Reads/writes sidecar-data.json)
├── MediaCapture.js (Orchestrates screenshots and audio buffers)
├── TranscriptionService.js (Adapts OpenAI/Gemini audio transcripts)
├── LlmService.js (Handles OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini text streams)
├── ShortcutsManager.js (Registers global shortcut listeners — CommandOrControl)
└── IpcRouter.js (IPC routing, background STT loop & model check)

Preload Script (Bridge)
└── index.js (Exposes contextBridge API: window.sidecar)

Renderer Process (React + Vite)
├── App.jsx (State coordinator)
├── index.css (Custom CSS design system)
└── components/ (React views: Header, Composer, Panels, Preferences)
```

1. **Loopback Audio Engine**: Buffers output audio (system speaker channel) and input audio (microphone channel) separately to run independent Whisper or Gemini STT APIs, keeping dialogue turns tagged correctly. Uses WASAPI loopback on Windows and CoreAudio on macOS.
2. **Visual Content Protection**: The window manager flags the transparent overlay with OS content filters to mask the copilot panel from OBS, Zoom screen shares, or screenshots. On Windows, uses `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` (Windows 10 2004+).

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Google Gemini API 404 Errors
If you configure a Gemini API key and receive `404 NOT_FOUND` errors, check that you are using active model versions.
* **Auto-Fallback Check**: Sidecar runs a lightweight, non-blocking check on startup that queries `GET /v1beta/models`. If your configured model is deprecated or retired, it automatically upgrades to the first active Flash model and displays:
  > `"Gemini model updated automatically — old model was retired."`
* **API Version**: The app targets the `v1beta` endpoint version (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta`) which supports newer Gemini 2.5 models.

### Windows-Specific Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| SmartScreen blocks the installer | Click "More info" → "Run anyway". The app is not code-signed yet. |
| Overlay visible in screen captures | Ensure you are running Windows 10 v2004+ (build 19041). Older versions use weaker protection. |
| System audio not captured | Verify Electron 33+ is installed. WASAPI loopback requires Windows 10 or later. |
| `Ctrl+H` opens browser history | This shortcut is intercepted by Electron's global shortcut system and should work. If it conflicts, ensure no other app is capturing it. |

## Windows Icon

> **Note:** The current Windows icon (`docs/icon.ico`) is a placeholder. It should be replaced with a properly designed application icon before release. The icon is used by the NSIS installer and the Windows taskbar/title bar.
